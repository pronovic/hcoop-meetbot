Remaining tasks for this PR:

[ ] Unit test state.py
[ ] Unit test handler.py in terms of stubbed state and message interfaces
[ ] Unit tests the parts of message.py that are implemented (dispatch and save will remain unimplemented)
[ ] Figure out a way to maintain state on reload (I couldn't get Richard's original pattern to work)

Tasks prior to release:

[ ] Check whether reload can be used to reload configuration.  If so, update docs to reflect that.
[ ] Add coveralls to the Tox test suite
[ ] Configure readthedocs so docs are built (once repo is public)
