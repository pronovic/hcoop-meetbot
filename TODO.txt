Remaining development tasks:

- Check whether reload can be used to reload configuration.
  If so, update docs to reflect that.

- Add coveralls to the Tox test suite

- Configure readthedocs so docs are built (once repo is public)

- Fix LICENSE file to attribute properly (per instructions on bottom of the file)
