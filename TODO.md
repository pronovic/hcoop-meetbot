Tasks for future PRs:

[ ] Implement and test writer.py
[ ] Figure out whether I'm doing the right thing with actions - I don't understand this

Tasks prior to release:

[ ] Check whether reload can be used to reload configuration.  If so, update docs to reflect that.
[ ] Add coveralls to the Tox test suite
[ ] Configure readthedocs so docs are built (once repo is public)
