This is a plugin for Limnoria_, a bot framework for IRC.  It is designed to help run meetings on IRC.  At HCOOP_, we use it to run our quarterly board meetings.

The code is based in part on the MeetBot_ plugin for Supybot written by Richard Darst. Supybot is the predecessor to Limnoria.  Richard's MeetBot was "inspired by the original MeetBot, by Holger Levsen, which was itself a derivative of Mootbot by the Ubuntu Scribes team".  So, this code has a relatively long history.  For this version, much of the plugin was rewritten using Python 3, but it generally follows the pattern set by Richard's original code.

Using the Plugin
----------------

The plugin is distributed as a PyPI package.  This mechanism makes it very easy to install the plugin, but prevents us from using the standard Limnoria configuration mechanism.  This is because the ``supybot-wizard`` command is not aware of the ``HcoopMeetbot`` plugin.  Instead, you have to create a small ``.conf`` file on disk to configure the plugin.

Install and Configure Limnoria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, install Limnoria following the instructions_.  There are also more details under getting-started_.

Choose a directory and run ``supybot-wizard`` to initialize a bot called ``meetbot``.  Make sure to select ``y`` for the the question **Would you like to add an owner user for your bot?**  You will need to identify yourself to the bot to install the plugin.  

Install and Configure HcoopMeetbot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the package from PyPI::

   $ pip install hcoop-meetbot

Make sure to use ``pip`` (or ``pip3``) for the same Python 3 installation that runs Limnoria, otherwise Limnoria won't be able to find the package.

Next, add configuration.  Create a file ``HcoopMeetbot.conf`` in the ``conf`` directory for your Limnoria bot.  Fill four values into the file::

   [HcoopMeetbot]
   logDir = /home/myuser/meetings
   urlPrefix = https://example.com/meetings
   pattern = %%Y/%(channel)s.%%Y%%m%%d.%%H%%M
   timezone = UTC

If you skip this step and don't create a config file, the plugin will try to use sensible defaults as shown below.

+---------------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Parameter     | Default Value                          | Description                                                         |
+===============+========================================+=====================================================================+
| ``logDir``    | ``$HOME/hcoop-meetbot``                | Absolute path where meeting logs will be written.                   |
+---------------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``urlPrefix`` | ``/``                                  | URL prefix to place on generated links to logfiles.                 |
+---------------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``pattern``   | ``%%Y/%(channel)s.%%Y%%m%%d.%%H%%M``   | Pattern for files generated in ``logFileDir``.  Use ``%(channel)s`` |
|               |                                        | for the channel name and strftime_ format codes for dates.  If      |
|               |                                        | you use strftime format codes, you must double the ``%%``.          |
+---------------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``timezone``  | ``UTC``                                | Any timezone valid for pytz_, like ``UTC``,                         |
|               |                                        | ``US/Eastern``, or ``America/Chicago``.                             |
+---------------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

Run the Bot
~~~~~~~~~~~

Start Limnoria (for instance with ``supybot ./meetbot.conf``) and ensure that it connects to your IRC server.

Open a query to talk privately with the bot, using ``/q meetbot``.  Identify yourself to the bot with ``identify <user> <password>``, using the username and password you configured above via ``supybot-wizard`` - or use some other mechanism to identify yourself.  At this point, you have the rights to make adminstrative changes in the bot.

Install the plugin using ``load HcoopMeetbot``.  You should see a response ``The operation succeeded.``  At this point, you can use the ``meetversion`` command to confirm which version of the plugin you are using and ``list HcoopMeetbot`` to see information about available commands::

   (localhost)
   02:22 -!- Irssi: Starting query in localhost with meetbot
   02:22 <ken> identify ken thesecret
   02:22 -meetbot(limnoria@127.0.0.1)- The operation succeeded.
   02:22 <ken> load HcoopMeetbot
   02:22 -meetbot(limnoria@127.0.0.1)- The operation succeeded.
   02:22 <ken> meetversion
   02:22 -meetbot(limnoria@127.0.0.1)- HcoopMeetbot v0.1.0, released 16 Feb 2021
   02:22 <ken> list HcoopMeetbot
   02:22 -meetbot(limnoria@127.0.0.1)- addchair, deletemeeting, listmeetings, meetversion, recent, and savemeetings

   [02:22] [ken(+i)] [2:localhost/meetbot]
   [meetbot]

Then you can join any channel that the Limnoria bot is configured to join, and start using the plugin immediately.

Later, if you update the plugin (``pip install --upgrade``), you can either stop and start the bot process, or use ``@reload HcoopMeetbot`` from within IRC.  You may need to identify yourself to Limnoria before doing this.
