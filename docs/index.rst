This is a plugin for Limnoria_, a bot framework for IRC.  It is designed to help run meetings on IRC.  At HCOOP_, we use it to run our quarterly board meetings.

The code is based in part on the MeetBot_ plugin for Supybot written by Richard Darst. Supybot is the predecessor to Limnoria.  Richard's MeetBot was "inspired by the original MeetBot, by Holger Levsen, which was itself a derivative of Mootbot by the Ubuntu Scribes team".  So, this code has a relatively long history.  For this version, much of the plugin was rewritten using Python 3, but it generally follows the pattern set by Richard's original code.
